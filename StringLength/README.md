The program imports the java.util.Scanner class, which allows for user input to be received from the console.

The main method is defined, which is the entry point for the program when it is run.

Within the main method, a try-with-resources block is used to create a new Scanner object sc which reads input from the console.

The program prompts the user to enter a string by printing "Enter a string: " to the console.

The nextLine() method is called on the Scanner object to receive the user's input as a String.

A variable length is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the length of the string.

A for loop is used to iterate over the characters in the str variable, starting at the first character (index 0).

The loop continues until the charAt() method returns the null character '\0'.

Within the loop, the length variable is incremented by 1 on each time, counting the number of characters in the string.
After the loop has finished, the program prints the calculated length of the string to the console, with the message "Length of the string: "

And then, the try-with-resources block is closed.
