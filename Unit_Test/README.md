The code first imports the necessary JUnit libraries and static assert methods from it.

The class "ConcatRemoveTest" is defined and within it, there is a test method called "testConcatRemove".

Within the "testConcatRemove" method, there are several assert statements that test the output of the "concatRemove" method against expected output.

The first set of assert statements test for successful cases where the output of the "concatRemove" method should be "yes". These test cases pass if the actual output of the "concatRemove" method matches the expected output.

The second set of assert statements test for failing cases where the output of the "concatRemove" method should not be "yes". These test cases pass if the actual output of the "concatRemove" method does not match the expected output.

NOTE:

I'm not one hundred percent SURE if this code is the best way to test the currently outputs.
