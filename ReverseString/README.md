The code imports the java.util.Scanner class, which allows for user input to be received from the console.

In the main method, a Scanner object is created and used to prompt the user to enter a string. The string entered by the user is stored in the variable 'str'.

The reverseString method is called and passed the 'str' variable as an argument. This method will reverse the order of the characters in the string.

The reverseString method starts by creating a char array 'chars' and assigns it the value of the string converted to an array of chars.

The method then uses a for loop that iterates over half of the characters in the array, swapping the characters at the beginning and end of the array.

Then the reversed string is returned as a new String object, created from the modified char array.

So, the main method prints the reversed string by concatenating the string "Reversed string: " with the reversed variable.
