The code iterates over a range of 1 to 100 (line 2); Inside the for loop, there is a series of if-else statements. The first if statement checks if the value of "i" is divisible by both 3 and 5 with  remainder equal to zero. If the result is true, the code will print "FooBaa" to the console (line 5).

 The first else-if statement (line 6) will check if i is divisible by 3 with remainder equal to zero, so the code prints the string “Foo” to the console. But, otherwise if it’s False. 
 
 The second else-if statement (line 8) will check if i is divisible by 5 with remainder equal to zero and print the string “Baa” to the console.

Otherwise, if all the if and else-if statements are false, the else statement (line 10) will print to the console the number i itself.
