The code starts defining the class called "concatRemove" which contains a single method called "concatRemove". The method takes in three parameters: a string "s", a string "t", and an integer "k".

The method starts by declaring two variables called "len_s" and "len_t", which store the length of the strings "s" and "t" respectively.

Next, it checks if the length of "s" is greater than or equal to the length of "t". If it is, it modifies the string "s" to be a substring of itself, starting from index 0 and ending at the index that is the difference between the lengths of "s" and "t".

The method then checks if the modified string "s" is equal to "t". If it is, it returns the string "yes".

Next, the method checks if the value of "k" is equal to the difference between the lengths of "t" and "s". If it is, it concatenates the substring of "t" starting from the length of "s" to the end of "t" with "s", and then checks if the result is equal to "t", if true it returns "yes"

Otherwise, the method returns the string "no".

The class also contains a main method that tests the concatRemove method by passing in several test cases. The test cases include two strings and an int k, and the function will return a string "yes" or "no" depending on the input.
